#### Web Analytics

**Ideal for**: any company which uses their website to find new customers.

I will often get an inquiry about helping with website traffic, but when I ask the person how much traffic they get now, they tell me they don't know – "but it can't be much, since I'm not making many sales".

But then why assume the problem is traffic? It could be that visitors don't know how to hire the service or buy the product, or even what the service or product does, and then leave. It could be a pricing strategy problem. It could be poorly targeted marketing causing the wrong visitors to come in – a massive waste of marketing money.

The only way to understand what's really going on with your site (and therefore how to improve it) is with a proper analytics setup. That means not only knowing how many people are coming in, but also from where, what they're doing once they land on your site, and where they're leaving.

If you have an e-business and don't track visitor activity, you might as well be throwing money out the window, often in the form of expensive SEO or pricey online ads that bring people to your site just to leave right away. Remember: it's far better to get 10 visitors a week who buy from you than 1000 visitors a week who don't.

As a business owner, you can't afford not to know what's going on, and you can't fix something if you don't know which part of it is broken.
