#### Automated Scheduling

**Ideal for:** coaches, consultants, private teachers, lawyers, therapists, any business which requires blocking out time.

If you have any kind of private practice, you know how important it is to follow-up on leads. When your main product is your own time, an hour you can't bill is an hour wasted.

Typical scenario: A lead gets your phone number from your website and tries to call you, but you're with a client and can't pick up the phone, and they just assume you're unavailable and hang up. Some time later, you see the caller ID and try to call back, only to find out that, with the immediate availability of Google, they were able to find someone else in seconds. You lost the sale, and weeks or months of recurring work.

People are impatient. They don't have time to try and reach out to you repeatedly, or to email back and forth with you trying to find time that works for both sides.

You could hire an assistant for a chunk of your hourly rate (keeping in mind that your unbillable hours are still billable for them), or you could use automated scheduling to solve the whole problem in one fell swoop.

Use the button below to schedule a one-hour session in which you and I will talk via Skype or phone, and I'll help you not only pick the best scheduling software for your needs (ranging from free to a small monthly price), but also integrate it with your website and email system. That way, you're always on top of your schedule.
